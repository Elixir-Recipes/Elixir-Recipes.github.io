An Elixir program can be represented by its own data structures as a nested (abstract syntax) tree of tuples with three elements. For example, the function call `run(1, 2, 3)` is represented internally as:

{% highlight elixir %}
{:run, [], [1, 2, 3]}
{% endhighlight %}

**Macros** in Elixir lets you perform [syntactic extensions](http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/syntax.html), which are expanded to before a program executes. We use macros to transform our internal program structure by treating code as data, and thus [metaprogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming).

## Example

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyModule do
  defmacro macro(code) do
    IO.inspect code
    code
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

We defined a macro with `defmacro`, and take in a block of code as arguments. Macros in Elixir transforms the block of `code` into its internal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation, which is a nested tree of triples (3-size tuples.) When the macro `macro` returns `code`, that internal representation is injected back into the global program's compile tree. In the above example, we just return it unmodified.

Let's call our macro:

{% highlight elixir %}
iex> require MyModule
iex> MyModule.macro((1+2)* 3)
{:*, [line: 3], [{:+, [line: 3], [1, 2]}, 3]}
iex> MyModule.macro(IO.puts("Sup"))
{ {:., [line: 4], [{:__aliases__, [counter: 0, line: 4], [:IO]}, :puts]},
 [line: 4], ["Sup"] }
{% endhighlight %}

What's most useful here is that we can modify that internal representation before returning, transforming it into a completely different piece of code.

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyModule do
  defmacro macro(code) do
    IO.inspect code
    newcode = quote do: IO.puts "Whatever."
    IO.inspect newcode
    newcode
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight elixir %}
iex> MyModule.macro((1+2)* 3)
{:*, [line: 10], [{:+, [line: 10], [1, 2]}, 3]}
{ {:., [], [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:IO]}, :puts]}, [], ["Whatever."]}
Whatever.
:ok
{% endhighlight %}

> Note that `code` was never executed/evaluated, only the returned `newcode` was executed.

`quote` lets us transform a block of code into its internal AST representation. Internally, `defmacro` calls this method to passed in parameters.

In the example above, we return a new internal representation `newcode` instead of the original `code`. Running the macro on any block of code results in the insertion and execution of our `newcode`.


What if we want to evaluate a code block? `unquote` lets you defer execution of the code block it receives, only running it when the code generated by `quote` is executed. You can only use `unquote` inside `quote` blocks.

Here's an example:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyModule do
  defmacro macro(code) do
    IO.inspect code
    quote do
      result = unquote(code)
      IO.inspect result
      case result do
        val when is_number(result) -> result
        _ -> IO.puts "Not a number"
      end
    end
  end=
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight elixir %}
iex> MyModule.macro(1+2*3)
{:+, [line: 40], [1, {:*, [line: 40], [2, 3]}]}
7
7
iex> MyModule.macro("Hello" <> " world")
{:<>, [line: 42], ["Hello", " world"]}
"Hello world"
Not a number
:ok
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, we evaluate code using `unquote` and use its result to perform some computation dispatched via pattern matching.

You can find real life examples of macros in [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/lib/phoenix/router.ex#L344-L358) and [ExUnit](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/lib/ex_unit/lib/ex_unit/assertions.ex#L95-L169).
