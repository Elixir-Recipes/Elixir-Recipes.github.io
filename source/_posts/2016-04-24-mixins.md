Let's demystify the frequently used `use` keyword in Elixir.

We can use the `use` keyword in Elixir to package behaviour and implementation for use in other modules, similar to abstract base classes or mixins in other languages. Mixins reduce the amount of boilerplate in your modules, especially for library authors.

Mixins in Elixir are similar on the surface to `Concerns` in Ruby and `Traits` in Scala. Before we start, you should be somewhat familiar with [behaviours](http://elixir-recipes.github.io/modules/behaviours/) and [macros](http://elixir-recipes.github.io/metaprogramming/macros/).

## The `use` keyword

`use` requires the given module and calls the `__using__` macro defined for that module. To illustrate, both examples below are equivalent:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyModule do
  use Utils, argument: :value
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyModule do
  require Utils
  Utils.__using__(argument: :value)
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Example

Now take a look at the `Filter` module defined below: 

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule Filter do
   # Define behaviours which user modules have to implement, with type annotations
   @callback transform(String.t) :: String.t

  # When you call use in your module, the __using__ macro is called.
  defmacro __using__(_params) do
    quote do
      # User modules must implement the Filter callbacks
      @behaviour Filter

      # Define implementation for user modules to use
      def shout, do: IO.puts("HEY!")
      def greet(s), do: IO.puts(s)

      # Defoverridable makes the given functions in the current module overridable
      # Without defoverridable, new definitions of greet will not be picked up
      defoverridable [shout: 0, greet: 1]
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

First, we define a behaviour callback `transform` with the `@callback` attribute. Modules that `use` the `Filter` module will need to implement `transform`. 

We then define the `__using__` macro using `defmacro`. `__using__` is called whenever the `use` keyword is called with this module. 

We can accept any `_params` specified in the `use` call, but we're not using any for this example.  

Within the body of the `__using__` macro, we use `quote` to return a quoted expression. The execution of this quoted expression is deferred until runtime, when the `use` keyword is executed within the user module. This lets us inject code to user modules.

> [Read this](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html) if you need a refresher on macros.

Here we use the `@behaviour` attribute to denote that modules that use `Filter` must implement the callbacks defined in `Filter`.

We define some default concrete implementations of `shout/0` and `greet/1` which will be injected to user modules. We then use `defoverridable` to denote that it can be overriden.

Now let's take a look at a `MyFilter` module which `use` the `Filter` module:

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyFilter do
  use Filter

  # Override default Filter implementation
  def greet(s), do: IO.puts("Sup " <> s)
end
{% endhighlight %}

In our module we override the `greet/1` function with our own implementation.

> If we didn't explicitly add `greet/1` to our `defoverridable`, new definitions of `greet/1` will not be picked up and we would use the original definition instead.

However, compiling the above module gives us the following warning: `warning: undefined behaviour function transform/1 (for behaviour Filter)`. This is because we're missing a required behaviour implementation `transform`. Let's implement all our behaviour callbacks: 

{% highlight elixir %}
defmodule MyFilter do
  use Filter
  
  def transform(s), do: s

  # Override default Filter implementation
  def greet(s), do: IO.puts("Sup" <> s)
end
{% endhighlight %}

`MyFilter` will now compile without warnings. With just a single line of code, we've injected `MyFilter` with behaviours and default overridable implementation:

{% highlight elixir %}iex> MyFilter.transform "yay"
yay
:ok
iex> MyFilter.shout
HEY!
:ok
iex> MyFilter.greet "Yos"
Sup Yos
:ok
{% endhighlight %}

## Other Examples

If you've played around with the OTP, you would have come across `use GenServer`. The [`GenServer`](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/GenServer.html) module uses `use` to give developers a set of default client-server functionality which can be overriden. [Here](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/lib/elixir/lib/gen_server.ex#L415-L462) is an excerpt of its `__using__` macro:

{% highlight elixir %}

  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote location: :keep do
      @behaviour :gen_server

      @doc false
      def init(args) do
        {:ok, args}
      end

      @doc false
      def handle_call(msg, _from, state) do
        # We do this to trick Dialyzer to not complain about non-local returns.
        reason = {:bad_call, msg}
        case :erlang.phash2(1, 1) do
          0 -> exit(reason)
          1 -> {:stop, reason, state}
        end
      end

      @doc false
      def handle_info(_msg, state) do
        {:noreply, state}
      end

      @doc false
      def handle_cast(msg, state) do
        # We do this to trick Dialyzer to not complain about non-local returns.
        reason = {:bad_cast, msg}
        case :erlang.phash2(1, 1) do
          0 -> exit(reason)
          1 -> {:stop, reason, state}
        end
      end

      @doc false
      def terminate(_reason, _state) do
        :ok
      end

      @doc false
      def code_change(_old, state, _extra) do
        {:ok, state}
      end

      defoverridable [init: 1, handle_call: 3, handle_info: 2,
                      handle_cast: 2, terminate: 2, code_change: 3]
    end
  end

{% endhighlight %}

## Alternatives to `use`

If you don't need metaprogramming, control over method overriding, nor pass in parameters to your `use` call - look into using [`import`](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/alias-require-and-import.html#import) instead.

## In Closing

Mixins are a powerful way to organize your modules that is well worth its place in your Elixir toolbox. I hope I have helped you dispel the magic of `use`. You should have a better understanding on how you can use mixins to inject code into other modules and reduce boilerplate.
